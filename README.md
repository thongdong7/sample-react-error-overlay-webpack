> Sample setup `react-error-overlay` for webpack dev server

# Setup
```
$ yarn
```

# Run

```
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```

Open http://localhost:9000/dist/ to see the overlay error

Note:

* `yarn build` is to generate the `dist/main.bundle.js`, it should be integrated into `yarn start` somehow.
